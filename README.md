```lrc
[00:45.15] Once in your life you will find her
[00:48.44] Someone that turns your heart around
[00:52.18] And next thing you know
[00:54.23] You're closing down the town
[00:59.52] Wake up and it's still with you
[01:03.14] Even though you left her way cross town
[01:07.10] Wonderin' to yourself
[01:10.08] Hey what have I found
[01:20.58] 
[01:14.77] ※When you get caught
[01:16.72] Between the moon and New York City
[01:20.63] I know it's crazy but it's true
[01:29.92] If you get caught
[01:31.71] Between the moon and New York City
[01:36.89] The best that you can do
[01:40.41] The best that you can do
[01:43.93] Is fall in love※
[01:51.93] 
[01:48.87] Arthur, he does as he pleases
[01:52.45] All of his life his master's toys
[01:55.92] And deep in his heart he's just
[01:59.02] He's just a boy
[02:03.78] Living his life one day at a time
[02:07.29] He's showing himself a pretty good time
[02:10.70] He's laughing about the way
[02:14.43] They want him to be
[02:23.93] 
[02:19.17] (※くり返し×2)
